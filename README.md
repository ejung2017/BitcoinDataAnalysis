# BitcoinDataAnalysis
Used Jupyter notebook

Goal: 

Workflow: 
- Understand the use case
- Run ETL pipeline
- EDA
- Conclusions

Steps: 
1. Data extraction - collect data from multiple sources (raw data)
2. Data transformation - clean and structurize the data into an acceptable format
3. Load Data - use the transformed, featurized data to perform various data analysis

EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis - leveraging different tools, plots, libraries to come up with a meaningful conclusion. 

Libraries used: 
1. Pandas - collect, manipulate, clean, perform numerical tasks on data
2. Matplotlib - data visualization package
3. Plotlib - used to create dynamic plot
4. NumPy - numerical computations on top of data
5. Seaborn - beautify plots
